The method of my project is first to create a path to the html files used for the project.Then define rerive html,parse and rank method to search for the words in the files.Then I created a node data structure that contains the character or substrnig within a given word.Then I created a trie data structure which stores one attribute, a link to it's root node, who's char is blank and an addWord method that creates all the nodes necessary to create an index term within the trie, and initiates all the index terms attributes like isIndexTerm, rank, and occurenceList. Then for the main function,I created a search engine object that initializes with a trie.The methods includes crawlPage which can crawl a page or an html file and add all the words in that file to the trie as index terms.Besides it includes compressTrie method which compresses the trie, making searching more efficient.Futhermore,the searchWord method searches a word in the compressed trie and returns the occurence list of that index term if it exists, otherwise it returns "None".
